Handle Asynchronous Operations Correctly:
    Since the map function is used with async/await, it returns an array of Promises. You should use Promise.all to wait for all the promises to resolve before processing the data. Additionally, handle any errors that might occur during the API requests.

Proper JSON Response:
    Instead of manually converting the response to a JSON string using JSON.stringify, you can send the response as JSON using res.json().
